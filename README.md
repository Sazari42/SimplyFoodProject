# Simply Food

> Is a project demonstrating my vue-js 2 practice and knowledge i've gained so far, it represents a gallery with animated cards, description of the cards is available upon clicking on them.

Future plans on updating:
-Add an emit event, so the color of text would change also in the footer?(not sure if it'll be effective, trying to avoid event buses)
-Add a cart flair on the side and "add to cart" button near to description of each item
-Dynamically update cart counter each time a new item was added
-Make a cart list expandable with the list of added items in it
-Make items removable from the list
-per aspera ad astra \o/


## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
